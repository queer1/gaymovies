Traditional moving rating systems (e.g. 1-to-10 stars) are problematic in at 
least two areas:

  1. They are skewed toward the high end because viewers typically self-select
     "good" movies prior to viewing them (i.e. they seldom watch or rank really
     bad movies.)
  2. It is difficult for a user to be consistent in their rankings because of
     the rather arbirtrary nature of assigning a number ranking.

The ELO rating algorithm (used for chess rankings and made famous by 
Zuckerberg's facemash.com) could overcome both of these deficiencies by 
providing a side-by-side comparison of two movies with the user merely 
selecting which movie is the best of the two. Here's a general idea of how
I would apply it for movie rankings:

 - Users rate movies head-to-head to determine their own personal rating
 - Their head-to-head ratings also help determine a global rating
 - Use ratings to define ranking of movies seen
 - Use ratings to determine a viewer profile and movie recommendation from the
   list of movies not-seen (Machine learning; What should I watch tonight?)
 - Further refine viewer profile based on genre, friends?
 - Further application areas to consider: global movie ratings, 
   special movie classes (e.g. gay movies), specific classes (film festivals), 
   global book ratings.

Rating system impementation...

 - Weighted random selection of two movies to present for head-to-head rating
 - Need to decide if ties are allowed in head-to-head rating
 - Need to be able to 'skip' rating two movies so as not to poison the rating 
   by forcing ratings when the user doesn't have a strong opinion
 - New movies are given a provisional rating based on IMDB/Rotten/Global
 - Rating of provisionally rated movies will only effect their score, not the
   score of head-to-head non-provisional movies. (i.e. don't give any credence
   to provisionally rated movies until there is some rating history)
 - Movies which are both provisional will have dual effect
 - Determination as to when to move a film from provisional to established
   will be based on how many established movies it's been rated against.

Refinement of rating algorithm...

 - Do some initial studies to validate rating algorighm
 - Start with an assumed "correct" rating and measure how successful the
   algorithm is in reproducing that correct rating in the fewest number of
   selections
 - Study the impact of having a small number of movies vs. a ton of them.

Summary of Design Goals:

- Support login via Facebook (ease of use, socially aware website)
- Allow users to "like" the site as well as individual movies on Facebook
- Allow users to rate movies using 10-star system (SEE DISCUSSION OF RATIONALE
  AT END OF DOCUMENT)
- At any given time, Allow users to view one selected FB friend's ratings and 
  compare with their own.
- Support short user comments about movies in lieu of full reviews (less 
  intimidating to write)
- Allow users to classify movies based (seen, not seen, want to see, etc.)
- Support "Combo Rating" which merges external ratings (e.g. IMDB) with user
  and friend ratings. Use normalizatin and user/friend weighting when 
  determining this combo rating.
- Provide weekly movie recommendations (make these timely i.e. have them
  consider DVD releases, Gay Pride, National Coming Out Day, etc.)
- Provide external links for quick additional information (IMDB, 
  RottenTomatos, etc.)
- Provide highly visible button links to certain sites ("Buy from Amazon",
  Scarecrow)
- Support ability to add special categories of films (e.g. SIFF movies)
- Provide a "tips" line to help new users navigate the site
- Use menus and tabs for navigation of the site (intuitive, hides site
  complexity)
- Support (but discourage!) non-facebook login
- Ensure site is useful even for those that don't want to join as a user.
- Support various classes of users (admin, regular, non-facebook)
- Provide FAQ, Terms of Service, and Privacy Statement.

Admin-only Features:

- Make it as easy as possible to add new movies
  1. Add title to simple form
  2. "submit" brings up full form with links which launch search on IMDB, 
     Amazon, etc.
  3. "Drag / Drop" url for external rankings and movie thumbnail
- Provide filters for listing movies which are missing certain pieces of 
  information (e.g. "missing IMDB rating")

Future Work:

- Provide for automatic, periodic updating of external ratings (i.e. no manual
  intervention by administrator)
- Add support for ELO ranking algorithm!

Discussion of movie rankings; Why I chose 10-star rating:
---------------------------------------------------------

One problem with the rating of movies by USERS (as opposed to critics), is
that users tend to self-select only "good" movies to rate. Folks rarely 
watch movies that are bad (less than 5 out of 10) because they do enough
research BEFORE viewing the movie, thus avoiding bad movies. As a result,
user rankings are going to be skewed toward the higher end of any scale. This
is the impetus for using a 10-star system instead of 5-stars; it provides
more resolution in the "over-used" high-end of the ranking system. I suspect
this phenemenon is not AS pronounced for critic reviews since they tend to
review most movies that are released. There is still, however, some degree (one
would hope!) of self-selection within the movie industry itself, so I would
still expect to see some skewing for the rankings (i.e. really bad movies
rarely see the light of day).

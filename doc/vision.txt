Rollout...

 - Have fun - only implement ideas that make it useful to me
 - Guard inellectual property rights to the idea from the outset
 - Register potential website names upfront
 - Logo / typeface design
 - Longterm vision .. facebook app, iphone app, website
 - How to leverage the idea to make some money? click thru ads, sell movies?
 - Initially do tests on gay movie ratings with friends
 - Use SIFF or SLGFF for initial public rollout?

Intellectual Property Protection...

 - Application of ELO algorithm (how provisional ratings are handled, scoring,
   ability to detect cheaters, ability to predict movie likes/dislikes) will
   be treated as a trade secret and not disclosed.
 - All software will be copyrighted and not shared with anyone initially.
 - Consideration will be made to applying for patents for gayFilmMesh,
   filmMesh and bookMesh.

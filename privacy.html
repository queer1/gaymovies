<h2>Site Privacy Statement</h2>

<p><b>In order to rate movies, see your friend's ratings and share your own ratings with friends, you must login via your Facebook account. </b></p>

<p>This website will ONLY have access to the information that is ALREADY PUBLIC on your facebook page. Here is the specific information that we use from facebook:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your unique Facebook <b>UserId</b> is stored internally to 
    identify you.</li>
<li>Your <b>Firstname</b> and <b>Lastname</b> are stored so that they can 
    be displayed to your friends.</li>
<li>Your <b>friend's list is accessed (but not saved)</b> to show you a list 
    of friends which also have accounts on here so that you can view their 
    ratings.</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, we do NOT access your email addresses, home address, or phone
numbers, nor will we share ANY information with any third party. Furthermore,
any attempt by this website to access any of your private information IN THE
FUTURE, would result in an authorization dialog box being displayed. (We aren't
planning to do this anyway, but the point is that Facebook would inform you
on-login even if we did).</p>

<p>If you don't trust us, Facebook, or the above statements in general and are 
concerned about your privacy, you can be given a "standard" (non-facebook) 
account upon request (see contact info below). With a standard account, you 
could rate movies but you couldn't share the ratings or see your friend's 
ratings.</p>

<p>This website gathers your movie ratings and comments for specific movies that
you choose. This informaion may be shared with others on the site including 
but not limited to your facebook friends. In addition, the information will be
used to determine average ratings, movie recommendations, and other unspecified
derivative information.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, you may contact us at

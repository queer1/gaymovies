<b>Welcome to The Gay Movie List</b>

This page provides a brief explanation of the website; it won't be
shown to you again.  Here's what you can do on the website:

MOVIE LIST PAGE...

- Sort the list of movies on the main page by various ratings.
- Change whether you're viewing a list of movies or small or large icons.
- View movies by your status (seen, not-seen, etc.)
- Select a facebook friend to view their ratings, status and comments 
  for movies.
- Click on IMDB and Rotten Tomato links to view more info about a movie
  or to see the trailer.

INDIVIDUAL MOVIE PAGE...  

- CLICK ON A MOVIE ICON to see/set more information about the movie, 
  including any comment your currently selected friend has added.
- When viewing a single movie's information, switch to 'rate' mode to...
    1) add your own rating to a movie 
    2) change its status (whether you've seen or want to see it) 
    3) add a brief comment about the movie. (250 characters or less)
- Click on the Amazon button to purchase the movie from amazon.com.
- Click on IMDB and Rotten Tomato links to view more info about a movie
  or to see the trailer.

It is hoped that the site will inspire you to view more movies and 
share them with all of us via the site. This is just the beta version 
of the site. In the future, it will be cleaned up to look better and 
there will be QUITE A FEW OTHER FEATURES ADDED.
